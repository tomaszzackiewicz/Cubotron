CUBOTRON

It is an rotating cube with small colorful cubes inside 
that can explode when it gets an input of an user.
This is an example of implementing some design patterns in Unity3D. 
I used Observer, Command, Factory, Pool and Singleton in this project.

A potential designer have many ways to tune the mechanics, among others, 
they can use the exposed data in some scriptabe objects.
